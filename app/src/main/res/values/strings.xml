    <string name="Endo_Risk_Factors">
1-Superficial Endometriosis: This form is mainly located in the pelvic peritoneum, which is the thin tissue lining the pelvis.\n
2-Endometrioma (Ovarian Endometriosis): This form involves the development of endometriotic cysts, also known as endometriomas, within the ovaries.\n
3-Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE): This form is characterized by the presence of endometriotic lesions that deeply infiltrate tissues beyond the pelvic peritoneum. It commonly affects areas such as the rectovaginal septum (the tissue between the rectum and vagina), the bladder, and the rectum.\n
4-Rare Extrapelvic Lesions: In rare cases, endometriotic lesions can occur outside the pelvic region. This may include locations such as the diaphragm and thoracic cavity. These forms are known as thoracic and diaphragmatic endometriosis.\n
It's important to note that endometriosis can vary in its presentation and severity among individuals. These different forms help describe the specific locations where endometriosis lesions are found.\n

    <string name="Endo_general">
Research shows that there are some things that put a person at higher risk of developing endometriosis, including having:

A mother, sister or daughter who has endometriosis
An abnormal uterus, which is diagnosed by a doctor
Early menstruation (before age 11)
Shorter menstrual periods (less than 27 days on average)
Heavy menstrual periods lasting more than seven days
Some things that can lower the risk of endometriosis include:

Pregnancy and breastfeeding
Having your first period after age 14
Eating fruits, especially citrus fruits

    <string name="Endo_causes">
Doctors do not know exactly what causes endometriosis, but there are a few theories of what might cause it:

Blood or lymph system transport: Endometrial tissues are transported to other areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic systems, similar to the way cancer cells can spread through the body.
Direct transplantation: Endometrial cells may attach to the walls of the abdomen or other areas of the body after a surgery, such as a C-section or hysterectomy.
Genetics: Endometriosis seems to affect some families more often than others, so there may be a genetic link to the condition.
Reverse menstruation: Endometrial tissue goes into the fallopian tubes and the abdomen instead of exiting the body during a woman’s period.
Transformation: Other cells in the body may become endometrial cells and start growing outside the endometrium.

    <string name="Endo_symptom">
The most common signs of endometriosis are pain and infertility. Endometriosis pain typically presents as:

- Painful menstrual cramps that may go into the abdomen (stomach) or lower back
- Pain during or after sex

Other symptoms may include:
- Diarrhea or constipation during a menstrual period
- Fatigue or low energy
- Heavy or irregular periods
- Pain with urination or bowel movements during a menstrual period
- Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods
Each person’s experience with endometriosis is different. Women with endometriosis may have some of these symptoms, all of these symptoms or none of them. Having severe pain or other symptoms is not necessarily a sign of more severe endometriosis.
