    <string name="Endo_health_prob">How is Endometriosis treated?</string>
    <string name="Endo_importance">Why is it important to find out if I have Endometriosis?</string>

    <string name="Endo_Symptoms_answer">The most common symptom of Endometriosis is pelvic pain. The pain often occurs with menstruation, during ovulation, and/or in connection with sexual intercourse. However, a woman with Endometriosis may also experience pain at other times during her monthly cycle. Another symptom is infertility. Some women with Endometriosis also experience severe fatigue.</string>
    <string name="Endometriosis_answer"> Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is also found elsewhere in the body, mainly in the abdominal cavity.</string>
    <string name="Endo_riskFactors_answer">You are more likely to get Endometriosis if you have: \n•Never had children. \n•Menstrual periods that last more than seven days. \n•Short menstrual cycles (27 days or less). \n•A family member (mother, aunt, sister) with Endometriosis.\n•A health problem that prevents normal passage of menstrual blood flow. \n•Damage to the cells in the pelvis from an infection.</string>
    <string name="Endo_traitement_answer"> There is no cure for Endometriosis, but there are many treatments for the pain and infertility it causes. Talk with your doctor about what option is best for you. The treatment you choose will depend on your symptoms, age, and plans for getting pregnant.\nPain Medication -— For some women with mild symptoms, doctors may suggest taking over-the-counter medicines for pain.\nHormone Treatment — When pain medicine is not enough, doctors often recommend hormone medicines to treat Endometriosis. Only women who do not wish to become pregnant, can use these drugs.\n Surgery — Surgery is usually the best choice for women with severe Endometriosis with many growths, a great deal of pain, or fertility problems. </string>
    <string name="Endo_reducess_answer">Keep lower estrogen levels in your body.  Try: \n•Exercising regularly. \n•Keeping a low amount of body fat. \n•Avoiding large amounts of alcohol and drinks with caffeine</string>
    <string name="Endo_health_prob_answer">Growths of Endometriosis are benign (not cancerous), but they still can cause many problems. Tissue and blood that is shed into the body can cause inflammation, scar tissue, and pain. As endometrial tissue grows, it can cover or grow into the ovaries and block the fallopian tubes. Trapped blood in the ovaries can form cysts as well as cause inflammation scarring (adhesions) that sometimes bind organs together. This scar tissue may cause pelvic pain and make it difficult for women to get pregnant. The growths can also cause problems in the intestines and bladder.</string>
    <string name="Endo_importance_answer">Studies show that women with Endometriosis skip school, work, and social events. This health problem can strain relationships with your partner, friends, children, and co-workers. Plus, Endometriosis can make it difficult for a woman to get pregnant. When Endometriosis causes fertility problems, surgery can boost the chances of getting pregnant.</string>

    <string name="endo_qst1_answer">A condition where the uterine lining grows outside the uterus.</string>
    <string name="endo_qst1_justif">Endometriosis is characterized by the abnormal growth of tissue resembling the uterine lining outside the uterus. This tissue can attach to various pelvic organs, causing pain, inflammation, and potentially leading to the formation of cysts and adhesions.</string>
    <string name="endo_qst2">What are some common symptoms of endometriosis?</string>
    <string name="endo_qst2_opt1">Pelvic pain.</string>
    <string name="endo_qst2_opt2">Heavy menstrual bleeding.</string>

    <string name="fc_qst1_opt4">The ability to carry a pregnancy to term.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst1_answer">The ability to conceive a child.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst1_justif">Fertility refers to the biological capability of an individual to conceive and bear children. It encompasses the capacity of the reproductive system to facilitate the union of sperm and egg, leading to pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2">What is the most effective form of contraception?</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_opt1">Condoms.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_opt2">Oral contraceptives (the pill).</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_opt3">Intrauterine devices (IUDs).</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_opt4">Withdrawal method.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_answer">Intrauterine devices (IUDs).</string>
    <string name="fc_qst2_justif">Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are among the most effective forms of contraception. They have a very low failure rate due to their direct placement within the uterus, preventing fertilization and implantation.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst3">How do hormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy?</string>
    <string name="fc_qst3_opt1">By blocking the fallopian tubes.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst3_opt2">By thickening the cervical mucus.</string>

    <string name="fc_qst6_answer">Tracking menstrual cycles to determine fertility.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst6_justif">Natural family planning involves tracking menstrual cycles and fertility signs to identify the fertile window. Couples can then choose to abstain from intercourse during this period to avoid pregnancy without using artificial contraceptives.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst7">What is the purpose of sterilization as a contraceptive method?</string>

    <string name="fc_qst8">What is the recommended age to start using contraception?</string>
    <string name="fc_qst8_opt1">At the onset of menstruation.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst8_opt2">After the first sexual experience.</string>

    <string name="fc_qst8_answer">At the onset of menstruation.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst8_justif">The onset of menstruation, known as menarche, signifies the potential for fertility. It is recommended to start using contraception around this time to prevent unintended pregnancies as individuals become capable of reproductive functions.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9">Can contraceptives protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_opt1">Yes, all contraceptives provide protection against STIs.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_opt2">No, contraceptives do not protect against STIs.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_opt3">Only barrier methods of contraception provide protection against STIs.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_opt4">Contraceptives can sometimes protect against STIs.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_answer">No, contraceptives do not protect against STIs.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst9_justif">Most contraceptives are designed solely to prevent pregnancy and do not provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Barrier methods, like condoms, are the exception, offering dual protection by preventing both pregnancy and STI transmission.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10">What is the purpose of a contraceptive implant?</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_opt1">To provide long-term contraception.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_opt2">To prevent ovulation.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_opt3">To block the fallopian tubes.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_opt4">To thicken cervical mucus.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_answer">To provide long-term contraception.</string>
    <string name="fc_qst10_justif">Contraceptive implants are small devices inserted under the skin that release hormones to prevent pregnancy. They offer a highly effective, long-term contraceptive solution without the need for daily administration, providing continuous protection over several years.</string>
