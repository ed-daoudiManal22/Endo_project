    <string name="Endo_Symptoms_answer">The most common signs of endometriosis are pain and infertility.\nEndometriosis pain typically presents as:\n Painful menstrual cramps that may go into the abdomen (stomach) or lower back Pain during or after sex Other symptoms may include:  Diarrhea or constipation during a menstrual period Fatigue or low energy Heavy or irregular periods Pain with urination or bowel movements during a menstrual period Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods Each person’s experience with endometriosis is different.\n Women with endometriosis may have some of these symptoms, all of these symptoms or none of them. \nHaving severe pain or other symptoms is not necessarily a sign of more severe endometriosis.</string>
    <string name="Endometriosis_answer">Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. \nIt can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant.\n Endometriosis can start at a person s first menstrual period and last until menopause.</string>
    <string name="Endo_Infertility_answer">Endometriosis is one of the most common conditions linked to female infertility.\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine found that 24% to 50% of women with infertility have endometriosis. \nMild to moderate cases of endometriosis may only cause temporary infertility. \nSurgery to remove the endometrial tissue can help a woman become pregnant.  \nDoctors don’t know exactly how endometriosis affects fertility. \nScar tissue from endometriosis may affect the release of eggs from the ovaries or block the path of the egg through the fallopian tube so it cannot get to the uterus. \nEndometriosis may also damage sperm or fertilized eggs before they implant in the uterus.  \nMany women with endometriosis or endometriosis-related infertility can still get pregnant and carry a successful pregnancy. \nThere are treatment options, including fertility preservation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) that may help women become pregnant. \nTalk to your doctor about your fertility goals when discussing your endometriosis treatment plan.  \n3 Key Infertility Facts  Johns Hopkins fertility and gynecology</string>
    <string name="Endo_riskFactors_answer">Research shows that there are some things that put a person at higher risk of developing endometriosis, including having:  A mother, sister or daughter who has endometriosis An abnormal uterus, which is diagnosed by a doctor Early menstruation (before age 11) Shorter menstrual periods (less than 27 days on average) Heavy menstrual periods lasting more than seven days Some things that can lower the risk of endometriosis include:  Pregnancy and breastfeeding Having your first period after age 14 Eating fruits, especially citrus fruits</string>
    <string name="Endo_causes_answer">Doctors do not know exactly what causes endometriosis, but there are a few theories of what might cause it:  \nBlood or lymph system transport: Endometrial tissues are transported to other areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic systems, similar to the way cancer cells can spread through the body. \nDirect transplantation: Endometrial cells may attach to the walls of the abdomen or other areas of the body after a surgery, such as a C-section or hysterectomy. \nGenetics: Endometriosis seems to affect some families more often than others, so there may be a genetic link to the condition. \nReverse menstruation: Endometrial tissue goes into the fallopian tubes and the abdomen instead of exiting the body during a woman’s period. \nTransformation: Other cells in the body may become endometrial cells and start growing outside the endometrium.</string>
